Includes only sequences for SARS-Cov-2
Search Filters: only complete sequences, maximum 50 unknown bases, from Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe

Search filters described in Analysis plan yielded a file size that was way too large. Removed sequences from North America for more manageable file size.
